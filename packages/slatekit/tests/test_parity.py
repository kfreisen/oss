"""The kernel and the reference implementation must agree.

This is the most important test file in the package. Every performance claim
slatekit makes is a comparison against `benchmarks/baselines/reference.py`, and a
comparison only means something if both implementations do the same job. A fast
path that has quietly changed its behavior produces an excellent benchmark number
and a wrong answer.

**What parity means here, precisely.** Not byte-identical output: matching the Rust
lineup-for-lineup would require reimplementing xoshiro256++ and its float mapping
in Python, which is a lot of fragile code in service of a weaker guarantee than the
one below. What is asserted instead:

* every lineup either implementation produces satisfies every rule, checked by a
  validator written independently of both builders;
* both produce distinct lineups, and about as many of them;
* both explore comparably — neither collapses onto a narrow set of players;
* both respond the same way to the constraints being tightened.

Those are the properties a caller relies on. Bit-identity is not one of them.
