"""Scaffold-level checks: the package imports, the extension loads, and dispatch works.

These stay after slatekit is implemented. Because the compiled kernel is a hard
requirement rather than an optional accelerator, an import failure here is the fastest
signal that a wheel, a maturin build, or an abi3 tag is wrong — and it runs in
milliseconds.
