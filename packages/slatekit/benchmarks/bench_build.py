"""Benchmark: greedy construction against MILP and against pure Python.

Three implementations of the same job, on the same slate:

* `slatekit` — the Rust kernel.
* `reference` — the pure-Python transcription in `baselines/reference.py`, which
  is also the parity oracle. This is the honest measure of what the port bought.
* `milp_pulp` / `milp_ortools` — solver formulations from `baselines/milp.py`,
  producing distinct lineups via no-good cuts.

Reported as **lineups per second**, not seconds, so portfolio sizes that differ by
two orders of magnitude can be compared at all.

A note on what was expected and what was measured: the solver path adds a no-good
cut per lineup, so its cost looked like it should grow superlinearly. It does not,
at these sizes — roughly 20 s/lineup at n=3 and 15 s/lineup at n=10, i.e. slightly
*better* per lineup as the fixed setup cost amortizes. The cuts are cheap next to
the solve. Claiming superlinearity would have been a nice story and the numbers do
not support it.

Quality is measured too, in `bench_quality.py` — speed alone would be a misleading
thing to publish, since the solver produces *better individual lineups* and this
comparison would look like a win on every axis if only time were reported.

Run with:

    make bench PKG=slatekit
