"""Pure-Python transcription of the greedy construction algorithm.

This is the most valuable file in the package and it is not shipped in the wheel.
It serves three jobs at once:

1. **The specification.** The Rust is fast and the Rust is not readable. This is
   the same algorithm at a speed nobody cares about, written so the algorithm can
   be checked by reading it.
2. **The parity oracle.** `tests/test_parity.py` asserts this and the kernel
   produce *identical* lineups for the same seed. That is what makes a speedup
   number mean something: the two implementations are doing the same job.
3. **The benchmark baseline.** The headline comparison is against MILP, but the
   Python-versus-Rust number is the honest measure of what the port bought.

Because it is an oracle, it must be a *transcription*, not a reimplementation.
Where a more Pythonic expression would change the order of operations, the clumsy
version wins — the lane-by-lane structure here mirrors the Rust deliberately, down
to the tie-breaks and the RNG call sequence.

Determinism note: exact lineup-for-lineup parity with the Rust would require
reimplementing xoshiro256++ and its `random_range` mapping bit for bit. That is
not a useful thing to maintain, so the parity test asserts the invariants that
actually matter — validity, distinctness, and the *distribution* of the objective
— rather than byte-identical output. See `tests/test_parity.py` for exactly what
is claimed.
