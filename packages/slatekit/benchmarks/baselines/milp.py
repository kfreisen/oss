"""MILP formulations of the same problem, for comparison.

This is what slatekit is measured against, and it is important to be precise about
what the comparison shows — because the naive reading of it is wrong.

**A solver wins on one lineup.** Asked for the single best lineup, CBC returns the
optimum and the greedy builder returns something slightly worse. That is not in
dispute and this file exists partly to demonstrate it.

**The interesting question is a portfolio.** Asked for 150 lineups, a solver
returns the optimum, then the second best, then the third — which differ from each
other by one or two players. That is a terrible portfolio for a large-field
contest, where the payoff is convex and coverage of the outcome space is what pays.
Getting genuine diversity out of a solver means adding no-good cuts or overlap
constraints and re-solving once per lineup, and the cost of that is what the
benchmark measures.

So the honest framing is: **per-lineup quality favors the solver, and
lineups-per-second favors the greedy builder by orders of magnitude.** Both numbers
are reported.

PuLP with the bundled CBC is the baseline because it is open source and installs
everywhere. OR-Tools' CP-SAT is included as a second opinion — it is markedly
faster than CBC on this problem shape and makes the comparison harder for slatekit,
which is the point of including it. Gurobi would be faster still and is deliberately
absent: it needs a commercial license, so a benchmark nobody can reproduce.
