"""Ready-made roster specifications for common contest formats.

These are data, not code paths — every one is an ordinary
[`RosterSpec`][slatekit.spec.RosterSpec] you can copy and modify. There is no
branch anywhere in this package that asks which sport it is looking at.

Operators change these rules, sometimes mid-season. Treat a preset as a starting
point that was correct when written, and check it against the contest you are
actually entering.
