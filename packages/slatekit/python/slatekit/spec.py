"""Describing what makes a lineup legal.

A [`RosterSpec`][slatekit.spec.RosterSpec] is the sport-independent description of
a contest: which slots a roster has, which positions may fill each, what the salary
budget is, and how many players may share a key such as a team.

The two rules a daily-fantasy contest usually states as separate features — "at most
6 players from one team" and "at most 5 *hitters* from one team" — are the same
constraint here, differing only in which slots they count. That collapse is the
reason this generalizes past the sport it came from.
