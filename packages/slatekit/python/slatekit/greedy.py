"""Randomized greedy lineup construction.

Builds a large, diverse pool of *valid* lineups quickly. It is not trying to find
the best lineup — an ILP solver will beat it on any single one — because a
portfolio of 150 optimal lineups is 150 nearly identical lineups. Coverage of the
outcome space is what matters downstream, and randomized construction buys it for
a fraction of the cost.

Determinism is part of the contract: output depends on `seed` and `chunks` and
nothing else. Two runs on machines with different core counts agree exactly.

    Args:
        pool: Available players.
        spec: What makes a lineup legal.
        num_lineups: How many distinct lineups to return.
        seed: Base seed. With `chunks`, fixes the output exactly.
        noise: Uniform noise added to each objective, as a fraction of the
            player's projection. Zero removes the per-player randomness and
            collapses diversity to the profile draw alone.
        attempts_per_lineup: Attempts made per requested lineup before giving up.
            Attempts fail when the greedy fill paints itself into a corner, so a
            tightly constrained pool needs more.
        chunks: Independent work units. Fixed rather than derived from the CPU
            count, so results do not depend on the machine. Changing it changes
            the output.
        profiles: Jitter profiles cycled across attempts. Defaults to
            `(CONTRARIAN, STANDARD)`.

    Returns:
        An `(n, roster_size)` array of indices into `pool`, where columns follow
        `spec.slot_names()`. **`n` may be smaller than `num_lineups`** — that means
        the pool could not support more, which is a real answer rather than a
        failure. A 12-player slate with a salary floor may have only a handful of
        valid lineups.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the specification, pool, or arguments are inconsistent.
        KeyError: If the specification constrains a key the pool does not carry.
