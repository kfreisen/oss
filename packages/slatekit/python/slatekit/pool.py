        Each record needs `positions` (an iterable of position names), `salary`,
        and `projection`. `stddev`, `ownership`, and `name` are optional.

        Group keys are read from the record field named by the constraint's `key`
        and are mapped to dense integers, since string keys cannot cross into the
        kernel. A missing or `None` key becomes `-1`, meaning uncapped.

        Args:
            records: One mapping per player.
            spec: Specification whose positions encode the masks and whose group
                constraints determine which keys are needed.
            key_fields: Key names to extract. Defaults to those the spec's groups
                reference.
