# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately through GitHub's
[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/kfreisen/oss/security/advisories/new)
rather than opening a public issue.

Include the affected package and version, what an attacker can do with the issue, and a
reproduction if you have one. You should get an acknowledgement within a week.

These are small libraries maintained by one person in their own time — please size your
expectations accordingly. Fixes go out as a patch release on the affected package only.

## Supported versions

Only the latest released version of each package is supported. There are no long-term support
branches.

## Scope

In scope: anything in `packages/*/src/`, and the release workflows that publish them.

Out of scope: the benchmark baselines under `packages/*/benchmarks/baselines/`, which exist to
be compared against and are not part of any published distribution.
